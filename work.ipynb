    "The primary objective of this work is to explore the tools and methods presented throughout the course Programming Applied to Economics, taught by Professor Gustavo Ramos Sampaio. In addition, it aimed to address a relevant topic with real potential for academic research. The issue explored here was the evaluation of the impact of mobile internet access on the opening and closure of bank branches at the municipal level. For this, panel data were used to estimate fixed and random effects models. The preliminary results do not allow for major conclusions, as expected, but the signs of the coefficients in the random effects model were in line with expectations. The next steps for this work are to make better use of the sample (by incorporating monthly data, for example), improve the identification and specification of the model, and explore other related topics, such as the demand and supply of municipal credit."

    "Technological innovations have played a fundamental role in modernizing banking services in Brazil. Vilhalba and Bernardo (2023) investigate the impact of Pix, a technology introduced by the Central Bank of Brazil, on the accessibility of financial services, highlighting how this digital tool has facilitated financial inclusion and reduced the need for in-person interactions at bank branches​. Additionally, banks have heavily invested in technology to meet consumer demands for faster and more accessible services, as evidenced by the growth in the use of mobile banking and internet banking.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lucas de Sousa Lima (2024) complements this discussion by examining the impact of Pix on family farmers participating in the Agroamigo Crescer program. The study reveals that after Pix was implemented, there was a significant reduction in in-person transactions at bank branches, especially among farmers residing in municipalities different from their home branches​\n",
    ". This suggests that Pix not only facilitated financial transactions but also contributed to financial inclusion in rural areas where access to bank branches can be limited."

    "The development of self-service channels, such as ATMs, internet banking, and mobile banking, has profoundly changed the relationship between customers and banks in Brazil. Viana (2018) explores this evolution, showing that the adoption of these channels has enabled greater customer autonomy, allowing them to perform transactions at any time and from any location​. The research also highlights that the digitization of banking services has resulted in significant cost savings for financial institutions, while also requiring organizational restructuring to adapt to new technologies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, Lima (2024) identifies a similar trend among family farmers in the Agroamigo Crescer program. With the introduction of Pix, these farmers began to increasingly use self-service channels outside of bank branches, such as lottery kiosks and ATMs, demonstrating a clear preference for methods that offer greater convenience and lower costs​."

    "The adoption of new technologies in the banking sector has also brought about significant changes in consumer behavior. As observed by Viana (2018), customers are becoming increasingly familiar with complex operations on digital platforms, suggesting a continued growth in the use of self-service channels​. Additionally, Vilhalba and Bernardo (2023) note that Pix has become an essential tool for low-value transactions, highlighting a shift in consumer habits where convenience and speed are highly valued​.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lima (2024) reinforces this perspective by analyzing the effects of Pix on the transaction habits of family farmers. The research shows that despite the significant increase in digital transactions, in-person transactions are still common, especially in situations where access to digital technologies is limited or where there is a preference for cash transactions​. However, the general trend points to a continuous migration towards digital methods, driven by convenience and the need to reduce costs associated with travel to bank branches."

    "This work aimed to explore the programming tools applied to economics, presented by Prof. Gustavo, through a case study project on the quantitative determinants of bank branch openings and closures by municipality, which are not currently covered in the literature on the subject.\n",
    "\n",
    "The literature review indicates that technological innovations have promoted substantial transformation in the Brazilian banking system, both in terms of service offerings and consumer behavior. The digitization of services, exemplified by the growth of Pix and self-service channels, is redefining the relationship between banks and customers, making it more flexible and accessible. However, these advancements also present challenges, such as the need to ensure digital inclusion and organizational adaptation to address an increasingly competitive and technologically advanced environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Future research should continue to explore the impacts of these innovations, particularly concerning equitable access to financial services and the social and economic implications of these transformations. Additionally, it is crucial to investigate how financial institutions can continue to evolve to meet the growing expectations of consumers in a digitally oriented market.\n",
    "\n",
    "The preliminary results do not allow for major conclusions (as expected), but the coefficients of the random effects model were in line with expectations. The next steps in this research are to explore monthly data, improve model identification and specification, and seek a more extensive data window. Moreover, the work does not necessarily need to be limited to explaining branch openings and closures. It can also explore the determinants of municipal credit demand and supply."
