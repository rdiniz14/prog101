### Abstract

The primary objective of this work is to explore the tools and methods presented throughout the course Programming Applied to Economics, taught by Professor Gustavo Ramos Sampaio. In addition, it aimed to address a relevant topic with real potential for academic research. The issue explored here was the evaluation of the impact of mobile internet access on the opening and closure of bank branches at the municipal level. For this, panel data were used to estimate fixed and random effects models. The preliminary results do not allow for major conclusions, as expected, but the signs of the coefficients in the random effects model were in line with expectations. The next steps for this work are to make better use of the sample (by incorporating monthly data, for example), improve the identification and specification of the model, and explore other related topics, such as the demand and supply of municipal credit.
